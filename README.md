# natBASIC

A tiny interpreter for a tiny, useless dialect of BASIC.  Written as a demonstration of an extremely simple programming language interpreter, for a work presentation.

natBASIC is a line-numbered dialect of BASIC that only supports two instructions: `PRINT` and `GOTO`.  As any 80s kid knows, those are really the only two instructions you need.
